          <h2>Express yourself</h2>
          <p>
            Show off your unique personality, interests, and talents to the
            world. Whatever you're passionate about &ndash; art, music, sports,
            or science &ndash; showcase what makes you special.
          </p>

          <h2>Share your ideas and opinions</h2>
          <p>A place to share your thoughts, opinions, and ideas with others</p>

          <h2>Learn valuable skills</h2>
          <p>
            The entire web runs on HTML and CSS (plus Javascript and other
            things).
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a great way to learn about these important parts of web
            design, and have some fun, sharing your ideas, along the way.
