<header>This is the header. We might put a logo up here.</header>
<nav>Later, we'll put menu buttons here, so we can navigate to other pages.</nav>
<main>
  <h1>This is a H1 heading</h1>
  <h2>This is an H2 sub-heading</h2>
  <p>This is my main page content. <i>Not</i> a very attractive page. I'd go so far as to say, it <b>lacks style</b>!</p>

  <h2>Where are the other bits?</h2>
  <p>Do you remember all those other bits we need for a webpage? We haven't done any of these:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&lt;!doctype html&gt;</li>
    <li>&lt;html&gt;</li>
    <li>&lt;head&gt;</li>
    <li>&lt;body&gt;</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In <b>JSFiddle</b> we don't need to because it automatically puts those in when it's making the page. Everything here is being put inside the <b>&lt;body&gt;</b>. Once we start making our own pages we'll need to do that for ourselves.</p>
  <h2>To do list</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Make some more interesting content.</li>
    <li>Add some more items to this to do list!</li>
  </ol>
</main>
<footer>The footer goes here. Good for things like &copy; copyright notices.</footer>
