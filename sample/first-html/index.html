Hello! 

This is a really simple bit of HTML. It doesn't do much.

Hey, that's weird! Why is it putting everything on one long line???

Can you tidy up this page with some HTML tags?

Here's what you should do:
<ol>
<li>Make the line "Hello!" a level 1 heading.</li>
<li>Make the other lines into separate paragraphs.</li>
<li>Make the word "HTML" bold.</li>
<li>Make the words "It doesn't do much" italic.</li>
<li>Make the part that says, "that's weird!" bold AND italic.</li>
</ol>
