            Once we have some content, it's time to make it look good. Let's
            give it some style!
          </p>
          <p>The way we do that is with CSS (Cascading Style-Sheets).</p>
          <h2>Where to we add style?</h2>
          <p>
            We can add style directly into our HTML document using the
            <b>&lt;style&gt;</b> tag, and we can also put style directly on many
            HTML tags, but it's considered "best practice" to put them in a
            separate file. We'll come back to this.
          </p>
          <h2>CSS selectors</h2>
          <p>The CSS puts style onto one or more parts of our HTML.</p>
          <p>We identify which parts with a <b>selector</b>.</p>
