              It was used in writing and publishing to show how text should be
              formatted.
            </li>
            <li>
              An author or editor would write markup on the page to indicate
              where text should be bold or italic, or how the text should be
              aligned.
            </li>
            <li>
              The typesetter would then make the page using individual metal
              blocks for each letter. They had different sets of blocks for
              italic and bold type.
            </li>
